# J.P. Morgan's Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program
I just completed J.P. Morgan's Software Engineering on Forage. In the simulation I:

· Set up a local dev environment by downloading the necessary files, tools and dependencies.

· Interfaced with a stock price data feed, set up a system for data analysis, and developed financial data processing skills using Python and Git.

· Utilized JPMorgan Chase's open-source library Perspective to create a dynamic live graph with React and TypeScript. This graph effectively presents real-time data feeds in a visually engaging manner, enhancing traders' ability to monitor market trends with clarity and precision.
